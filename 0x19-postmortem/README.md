# Postmortem: Authentication Service Outage

## Issue Summary:
The outage on March 5th, 2024, lasting from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC), significantly impacted our platform's authentication service. During this time, users were unable to log in, leading to frustration and disruption of service. Approximately 30% of our user base was affected by this outage. The root cause of this incident was traced back to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which resulted in an uneven distribution of traffic to the authentication service, overloading it and rendering it inaccessible.

## Timeline:
- **10:00 AM:** Monitoring system alerted us to increased latency on the authentication service, indicating a potential issue. Engineers began investigating.
- **10:30 AM:** Initial suspicion of database performance issues due to high traffic load.
- **11:00 AM:** Misconfiguration in load balancer settings identified as the primary culprit.
- **11:30 AM:** Infrastructure team corrected the load balancer settings, resolving the issue.

## Misleading Investigation:
The initial focus on database performance as the possible cause of the latency issues led to a delay in identifying the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. This oversight prolonged the resolution time and increased the impact on our users.

## Escalation:
The incident was promptly escalated to the infrastructure team for further analysis and resolution.

## Resolution:
By 11:30 AM, the infrastructure team corrected the load balancer settings, ensuring the even distribution of traffic to the authentication service, thus restoring normal functionality to the platform.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an uneven distribution of traffic, overloading the authentication service. By correcting the load balancer settings, traffic was evenly distributed, alleviating the overload and ultimately restoring service functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, we have identified several corrective and preventative measures:
- Implement automated checks for all load balancer settings.
- Conduct regular load testing to ensure load balancer efficiency.
- Document load balancer configurations and update procedures for increased future clarity and accountability.

## Tasks:
- Implement automated checks for all load balancer settings.
- Conduct regular load testing to ensure load balancer efficiency.
- Document load balancer configurations and update procedures for increased future clarity and accountability.

This comprehensive postmortem provides a detailed analysis of the outage, its root cause, resolution, and measures to prevent future occurrences, thereby ensuring the reliability and stability of our platform.
